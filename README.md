# Histogram-Equalization

Histogram Equalization is an image processing technique that adjusts the
contrast of an image by using its histogram. To enhance the image’s contrast, it spreads
out the most frequent pixel intensity values or stretches out the intensity range of the
image. By accomplishing this, histogram equalization allows the image’s areas with
lower contrast to gain a higher contrast.

Histogram equalization is a straightforward image-processing technique often
used to achieve better quality images in black and white color scales in medical
applications such as digital X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans.
It is mainly used in gray scale images, satellite images.

The python code for image enhancement is given in [Program.py](program.py)
